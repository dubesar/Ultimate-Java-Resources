The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class.
It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. 
A class is like a blueprint for an object.

For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brand but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc. So here, Car is the class and wheels, speed limits, mileage are their properties.

  A Class is a user-defined data-type which has data members and member functions.
  Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to manipulate these variables and together these data members and member functions define the properties and behaviour of the objects in a Class.
  In the above example of class Car, the data member will be speed limit, mileage etc and member functions can apply brakes, increase speed etc.

We can say that a Class in C++ is a blue-print representing a group of objects which shares some common properties and behaviours.
