/*
The problem is to check if there is a subset in the given array whose sum is equal to the given number
For ex: if array is {{10, 3, 7, 6, 4, 8, 1} and given sum is 15, we have to return true since there is a subset of the array with sum 15 i.e (10,4,1)
We can solve this via Dynamic Programming!
We can divide the problem into two subproblems
1) include the last element recur for n-1 elements with sum = sum â€“ arr[n-1]
2) Exclude the last element, recur for n-1 elements with the original sum.
So every possible combination will be tried out including and excluding each element, hence the time complexity will be 2^n
