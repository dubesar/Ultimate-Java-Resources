JDBC API is a Java API that can access any kind of tabular data, especially data stored in a Relational Database. JDBC works with Java on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX


Why to Learn JDBC?

JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity, which is a standard Java API for database-independent connectivity between the Java programming language and a wide range of databases.

The JDBC library includes APIs for each of the tasks mentioned below that are commonly associated with database usage.

    Making a connection to a database.

    Creating SQL or MySQL statements.

    Executing SQL or MySQL queries in the database.

    Viewing & Modifying the resulting records.

	Applications of JDBC

Fundamentally, JDBC is a specification that provides a complete set of interfaces that allows for portable access to an underlying database. Java can be used to write different types of executables, such as âˆ’

    Java Applications

    Java Applets

    Java Servlets

    Java ServerPages (JSPs)

    Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs).

All of these different executables are able to use a JDBC driver to access a database, and take advantage of the stored data.

JDBC provides the same capabilities as ODBC, allowing Java programs to contain database-independent code.
