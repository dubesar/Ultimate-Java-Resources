# Object Oriented Programming

* Object-Oriented Programming or `OOPs` refers to languages that uses objects in programming. 

* Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc in programming.

* The main aim of `OOPs` is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

## OOPs Concepts:
* Polymorphism
* Inheritence
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Class
* Object
* Method

## 1) Polymorphism: 
* Polymorphism refers to the ability of OOPs programming languages to differentiate between entities with the same name efficiently. This is done by Java with the help of the signature and declaration of these entities.

* `Polymorphism` is a concept, which allows us to redefine the way something works, by either changing how it is done or by changing the parts using which it is done. Both the ways have different terms for them.
If we walk using our hands, and not legs, here we will change the parts used to perform something. Hence this is called `Overloading`.
And if there is a defined way of walking, but I wish to walk differently, but using my legs, like everyone else. Then I can walk like I want, this will be called as `Overriding`. 

```
// Java program to demonstrate Polymorphism 

// This class will contain 
// 3 methods with same name, 
// yet the program will 
// compile & run successfully 
public class Sum { 

	// Overloaded sum(). 
	// This sum takes two int parameters 
	public int sum(int x, int y) 
	{ 
		return (x + y); 
	} 

	// Overloaded sum(). 
	// This sum takes three int parameters 
	public int sum(int x, int y, int z) 
	{ 
		return (x + y + z); 
	} 

	// Overloaded sum(). 
	// This sum takes two double parameters 
	public double sum(double x, double y) 
	{ 
		return (x + y); 
	} 

	// Driver code 
	public static void main(String args[]) 
	{ 
		Sum s = new Sum(); 
		System.out.println(s.sum(10, 20)); 
		System.out.println(s.sum(10, 20, 30)); 
		System.out.println(s.sum(10.5, 20.5)); 
	} 
} 
```

## 2) Inheritence 
* `Inheritance` is an important pillar of OOP(Object Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allow to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.

* Considering HumanBeing a class, which has properties like hands, legs, eyes etc, and functions like walk, talk, eat, see etc. Male and Female are also classes, but most of the properties and functions are included in HumanBeing, hence they can inherit everything from class HumanBeing using the concept of Inheritance.

**Important terminology :-**
 * `Super Class:` The class whose features are inherited is known as superclass(or a base class or a parent class).

 * `Sub Class:` The class that inherits the other class is known as subclass(or a derived class, extended class, or child class). The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.

 * `Reusability:` Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class. 

 The keyword used for inheritance is **extends.**

**`Syntax:` -**
 ```
 class derived-class extends base-class  
{  
   //methods and fields  
}  
```

## 3) Encapsulation: 
* `Encapsulation` is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.

*  Our Legs are binded to help us walk. Our hands, help us hold things. This binding of the properties to functions is called `Encapsulation.`

* It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. Another way to think about encapsulation is, it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield

* Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class is hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of own class in which they are declared.

* As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as `data-hiding`.

* Encapsulation can be achieved by Declaring all the variables in the class as `private` and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.

## 4) Abstraction: 

* Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user.The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user. Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components.

* Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details. The properties and behaviours of an object differentiate it from other objects of similar type and also help in classifying/grouping the objects.

* Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerators will increase the speed of car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know about how on pressing the accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of accelerator, brakes etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.

* In java, abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes. We can achieve 100% abstraction using `interfaces`.

## 5) Class: 
* A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. In general, class declarations can include these components

1)  `Modifiers:`   A class can be public or has default access
2) `Class name:` The name should begin with a initial letter (capitalized by convention).
3) `Superclass:` (if any):  The name of the class’s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
4) `Interfaces:` (if any) : A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
5) `Body:` The class body surrounded by braces, { }.

## 6) Object: 

* It is a basic unit of Object Oriented Programming and represents the real life entities. A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists of:

## 7) Method:

* A method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return result to the caller. A method can perform some specific task without returning anything. Methods allow us to reuse the code without retyping the code. In Java, every method must be part of some class which is different from languages like C, C++ and Python.

* Methods are time savers and help us to reuse the code without retyping the code.

**In general, method declarations has six components:**

* `Access Modifier`  Defines access type of the method i.e. from where it can be accessed in your application. In Java, there 4 type of the access specifiers.

1) **public** : accessible in all class in your application.

2) **protected** : accessible within the package in which it is defined and in its subclass(es)(including subclasses declared outside the package)

3) **private** : accessible only within the class in which it is defined.
default (declared/defined without using any modifier): accessible within same class and package within which its class is defined.

4) **default (declared/defined without using any modifier)**
accessible within same class and package within which its class is defined.

* `The return type:` The data type of the value returned by the method or void if does not return a value.

* `Method Name:` the rules for field names apply to method names as well, but the convention is a little different.

* `Parameter list:` Comma separated list of the input parameters are defined, preceded with their data type, within the enclosed parenthesis. If there are no parameters, you must use empty parentheses ().

* `Exception list:` The exceptions you expect by the method can throw, you can specify these exception(s).

* `Method body:` it is enclosed between braces. The code you need to be executed to perform your intended operations.


## An exception (or exceptional event) is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. When an Exception occurs the normal flow of the program is disrupted and the program/Application terminates abnormally, which is not recommended, therefore, these exceptions are to be handled.

** An exception can occur for many different reasons. Following are some scenarios where an exception occurs.**

* A user has entered an invalid data.

* A file that needs to be opened cannot be found.

* A network connection has been lost in the middle of communications or the JVM has run out of memory.

* Some of these exceptions are caused by user error, others by programmer error, and others by physical resources that have failed in some manner.

* Based on these, we have three categories of Exceptions. You need to understand them to know how exception handling works in Java.

* Checked exceptions − A checked exception is an exception that is checked (notified) by the compiler at compilation-time, these are also called as compile time exceptions. These exceptions cannot simply be ignored, the programmer should take care of (handle) these exceptions.

* Unchecked exceptions − An unchecked exception is an exception that occurs at the time of execution. These are also called as Runtime Exceptions. These include programming bugs, such as logic errors or improper use of an API. Runtime exceptions are ignored at the time of compilation.

* Errors − These are not exceptions at all, but problems that arise beyond the control of the user or the programmer. Errors are typically ignored in your code because you can rarely do anything about an error. For example, if a stack overflow occurs, an error will arise. They are also ignored at the time of compilation.
